# RugbyScoreCounter
This app is a score counter for Rugby Union matches. This is the second project for Android Basics Nanodegree by Google. The goal was
design and implement an app to track scores between two teams playing a game.

# The skills

- Adding button code to your app
- Updating views
- Properly scoping variables
- Finding views by their ID

# Features
In RugbyScoreCounter I added the "undo" button for undoing the last updating of the score.
There are two layouts one fore the portrait mode and another for the landscape mode.
